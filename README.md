# rainfall_prediction_using_satellite_data

This project develop an AI-Driven Prediction System, Leverage advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost to analyze satellite-derived atmospheric variables, including thermal imagery, water vapor levels, and geometric factors, to predict rainfall intensity and likelihood effectively.

•	Integrate Real-Time Data Sources: Incorporate live weather updates from OpenWeatherAPI to dynamically adjust predictions based on real-time atmospheric conditions, ensuring location-specific and timely forecasts.

•	Enhance Forecast Accuracy: Utilize a combination of high-resolution satellite data and machine learning to deliver predictions with high precision, focusing on heavy and high-impact rainfall events.

•	Create an Interactive Interface: Design a user-friendly platform where users can input specific atmospheric conditions and receive instant rainfall predictions, making the system accessible to stakeholders like meteorologists, farmers, and urban planners.

•	Support Climate Resilience: Offer actionable insights to mitigate risks associated with extreme rainfall, enabling stakeholders to prepare for and respond to potential disasters proactively.
